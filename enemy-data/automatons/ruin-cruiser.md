# Automaton

## Ruin Cruiser

Legend has it that they were war machines left behind by a nation that had been destroyed. Compared to the more common Ruin Guards, their forms have greater value in the study of biomimesis. The distributed design and battle mode seem to have come from honeybee colonies, able to change forms and to attack from different directions.
