## Ruin Destroyer

Legend has it that they were war machines left behind by a nation that had been destroyed. Compared to the more common Ruin Guards, their design has greater value in the study of biomimesis. The giant crown, composed of several parts, looks like a scary plant. It's not known what one has to go through in order to design such scary machine.
