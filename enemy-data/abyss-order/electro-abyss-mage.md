# The Abyss Order

## Electro Abyss Mage

While studying at the Academia, researcher Alva Nicolai once conducted a systematic study of the Electro model used by the Electro Abyss Mage and came up with a theoretical weapon known as the Nicolai Coil. But it has yet to be put into practice. Some said his research materials were eaten during the flood of fungi.
