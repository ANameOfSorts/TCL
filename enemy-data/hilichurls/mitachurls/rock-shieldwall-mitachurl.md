# Hilichurls

## Rock Shieldwall Mitachurl

Fighting and eating meat are the two most important things to hilichurls, because those are what make them grow stronger. All young hilichurls dream of growing up to become a big and strong mitachurl, because that way they can eat more meat, fight more battles, and wield those (almost) impregnable giant rock shields.
