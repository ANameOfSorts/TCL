## Crackling Axe Mitachurl

Attacks with large strikes and uses Electro Slime to infuse their axes with Electro. They are very lethal. Axes forged from steel are excellent Electro-Charged Material. The image of those tall and strong Crackling Axe Mitachurls holding up their axes to summon thunder is quite majestic to the Hilichurls.
