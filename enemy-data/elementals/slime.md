{% tab title="Electro" %}
## Electro Slime

According to analyses, the jumping of Electro Slimes reflects the electric potential difference in the ground. In areas brimming over with Electro, their unusual movements can be observed and used to avoid danger.

{% tab title="Geo" %}

## Geo Slime

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Geo_Slime_Icon.webp)

Generally speaking, the crust of the earth is filled with Geo energy. Geo Slimes that are formed this way have a similarly "down-to-earth" sort of feeling.

{% tab title="Hydro" %}
## Hydro Slime

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Hydro_Slime_Icon.webp)

Legend has it that some people would use Hydro Slimes as an emergency water source, packing them in preparation for travels through dry regions or deep domains. But due to the high concentration of Hydro within these slimes, direct ingestion is, in fact, harmful to the human body.

## Attacks

* Hydro Slimes will apply Hydro to both Enemies and Allies in their surroundings:
  * When they land after the bouncing attack.
  * When they are hit by an attack, including attacks that they are immune to.
  * When they are unfrozen.

{% tab title="Pyro" %}
## Pyro Slime

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Pyro_Slime_Icon.webp)

Its intelligence is very basic, but its uses are just as broad â€” well, for hilichurls, that is.
