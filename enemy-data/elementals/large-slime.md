## Cryo Slime

## Electro Slime

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Large_Electro_Slime_Icon.webp)

According to analyses, the jumping of Electro Slimes reflects the electric potential difference in the ground. In areas brimming over with Electro, their unusual movements can be observed and used to avoid danger.

## Mutant Electro Slime

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Mutant_Electro_Slime_Icon.webp)

Electro Slimes can undergo mutations to become bright yellow. Due to the abundant Electro within its form, it will deliver an electric shock to its surroundings from time to time, and it can even cause nearby Electro Slimes to release electric arcs. This arc lightning will not bounce between purple Electro Slimes, which shows that Electro Slimes have two different polarities. One wonders if some great new science could emerge from the study of such phenomena...

{% tab title="Geo" %}

## Geo Slime

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Large_Geo_Slime_Icon.webp)

Generally speaking, the crust of the earth is filled with Geo energy. Geo Slimes that are formed this way have a similarly "down-to-earth" sort of feeling.

## Hydro Slime

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Large_Hydro_Slime_Icon.webp)

Legend has it that some people would use Hydro Slimes as an emergency water source, packing them in preparation for travels through dry regions or deep domains. But due to the high concentration of Hydro within these slimes, direct ingestion is, in fact, harmful to the human body.

Its intelligence is very basic, but its uses are just as broad â€” well, for hilichurls, that is.
