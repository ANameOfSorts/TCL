## Cryo Regisvine

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/abyss/Enemy_Cryo_Regisvine_Icon.webp)

A monster formed from a vine that was imbued with the essence of biting frost within the Ley Lines.

Some studies hold that plants are like organs of the world, harmonizing the turbulent elemental energies of the Ley Lines. Concrete examples of this phenomena are Mist Flowers, Whopperflowers and the like, which brim over with elemental energy.

In certain circumstances, certain plants will turn into creatures of monstrous size and intent — such as the Cryo Regisvines — over the course of many years.

## Pyro Regisvine

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/abyss/Enemy_Pyro_Regisvine_Icon.webp)

A giant vine that has absorbed the ancient flame that rages within the Ley Lines. It is restless, as if filled with an endless fury.

Poets, bards and even some academics believe that elements also contain emotions and hope. If this is true, then one can only wonder what emotions cause the Pyro Regisvine to burn eternally, writhing like one longing to be free of the confines of the earth...
