# Weekly Bosses

## Childe

He draws power from the ominous Delusion he possesses and fights using martial arts that he learned in a land of darkness. He is a pure warrior with an insatiable lust for battle. Each bloody conflict, each life-and-death struggle is a delightful trial to him. People say that the young Childe is famed throughout the land for his battle prowess. But he has never taken big talk of this kind to heart. After all..."You shall ever be the eye of the storm,"And the clashing of steel shall ever accompany you."The pitch-black memory of stepping into uttermost darkness,"Shall, at last, become the strength by which you will overturn this world."
