**Finding:** Electro crystals' pulse range works in a rectangle range, with the crystal being not centered, but rather between the center and the side

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8QfbYvuR6Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8QfbYvuR6Q)

**Significance:** electro crystals work in a similar way to cryo&pyro stamen flowers, for a better understanding of the overworld

### Invisible Water Layer

**Theory:**  
Genshin's water is coded in a way where the visual water and actual layer are separate, thus there is an invisible field of water that does not apply wet in random places of the world, but can be infused

**Evidence:**  
1. Invisible water being infused by Anemo MC: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR1zJjhqASI)  
   Invisible water being infused by Sucrose: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAXeOFUDlic) credits to @ishnu  
2. Invisible water infused by electro: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tpGWZ4hnfo)
3. Water hitbox & reactions from UNDER the water, UNDER the ocean: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWmhqgGfLaM)

**Significance:**  
Understanding the cursed overworld of Teyvat

### Overworld Entities Have Levels

**Finding:**  
Overworld has levels for every "body", including water and grass and sand, trees, rocks, and other things that we can't prove in any other way other than the game's code which shows this, thus varying stats which is proven by their damage.

**Evidence:**  
Flower stamens (cryo & pyro have the same scaling but different element): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gCbmYT5gPk)  
Water (using electrified): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSepgh_2M_M)  
Grass (using burning): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Xffbwx7b0)  

**Signifiance:**  
Almost cracking the code for overworld

### Genshin has 2D Water

**Finding:**  
Genshin's water exists only in horizontal, 2 dimensional sheets. Additionally, true water is not graphically represented at all times, while graphically represented water is only an approximation.

**Evidence:**  
[Album](https://imgur.com/a/j0b5Y5a)  
1 shows Jean standing in waterfall without getting wet.  
2 shows venti climbing into waterfall below the 2d plane of "true water" without getting wet, but getting wet when he climbs into it at a slightly higher angle. When Venti then falls through the waterfall, he remains dry the entire time before impacting the second 2D plane of water.  
Greyhound's videos demonstrate that such planes appear to have water properties from below (Clip 3), and that its edges in some cases look to be perfectly square (Clip  4). Razor illustrates the trouble with this in Clip 5 by electrocharging the "true water" hidden below a dry floor and hurting himself with the resulting electrocharge AoE.

**Significance:**  
Electro is awful for the overworld because you can electrocharge water which resides in a flat sheet invisibly below the ground with AoE attacks. By doing this, you take continuous damage while standing on a dry surface. Also, you can stand in waterfalls without getting wet.

### Environment Reactions Base

**Theory:**  
Environment uses a different set of reaction bases than players, thanks to the EM buffs and my prior testing of electro crystal levels, we can conclude that although the value at release was the same as for the player, now it's different, with the player having a new one, and the electro crystals using the old, unchanged base.

**Evidence:**  
The video shows a level 84 electro-charged tick of the pre 1.6 base (1243)

**Significance:**  
We're getting ever so closer to figuring out the cursed world of teyvat's code

## 4-piece set bonuses on environment reactions

**Bug:** Sometimes set bonuses do not work properly if triggered on unconventional sources

**Evidence:** [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPByPR2TubV4zjXSKhIhhWEww2Oo7Tmwh](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPByPR2TubV4zjXSKhIhhWEww2Oo7Tmwh)

**Significance:** This explains some strange damage numbers when fighting enemies in the overworld
