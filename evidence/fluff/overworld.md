**Finding:** Electro crystals' pulse range works in a rectangle range, with the crystal being not centered, but rather between the center and the side

**Significance:** electro crystals work in a similar way to cryo&pyro stamen flowers, for a better understanding of the overworld

**Bug:** Sometimes set bonuses do not work properly if triggered on unconventional sources

**Significance:** This explains some strange damage numbers when fighting enemies in the overworld
