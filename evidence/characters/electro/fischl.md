## 4pc Thundering Fury Effect Only Works if the Holder Procs the Reaction

By: Cenpi\#3224

The 4TF set effect adds 40% additional damage to electro-related reactions. In addition, everytime a reaction is proccd, the E CD is reduced by 1 second \(every 0.8s\).

The question is whether or not the holder must be the one proccing the reaction as opposed to a support.

For example, if Keqing has 4TF, applies electro, and Xiangling Guoba triggers overload, will this overload damage be increased by 40% or no?

The answer is no. In order to benefit from the increased damage, Keqing must be the one triggering the reaction.

This also applies for the cooldown reduction effect; Keqing must be the one triggering in order to get the cooldown reduction.

**Significance**

In solo PvE play, Keqing does NOT frequently trigger elemental reactions due to her high rate of application of electro.

Therefore, Keqing does not significantly benefit from the 4 set thundering fury effect.

## 4pc Thundering Furyâ€™s 40% Reaction DMG Increase Works When Wearer is Off-Field

By: Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Lix-\#3417

In short, yes. The 4 set TF increases reaction damage even if the holder is not on the field.

Note: No significant EM differences. Level differences are: Xiangling lvl 60; Fischl lvl 70

The following tests were conducted on a lvl 71 ruin guard:

Fischl proccing overload while present

Overload does 2066 damage

**Evidence**

Fischl proccing overload while not present

Overload does 2066 damage

See above video as well.

Xiangling proccing overload

Overload does 1077 damage

**Evidence**

Fischl \(with no 4 set\) proccing overload both while present and not present

Overload does 1476 damage regardless of whether fischl is on field or not

Evidence \(for fischl on field\)

Evidence \(for fischl not on field\)

**Significance**

This finding means that you can put 4TF on a support and get the bonus damage to reactions even if they are not on the field.

## 4pc Thundering Fury Holder, if not on-field cannot Benefit from the CD Reduction

By: Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Wrathior\#4848, Lix-\#3417

In short, no. The 4TF holder must be on the field to gain the benefit of the 1s CD reduction.

We know \(just to reaffirm\) that if the 4TF holder is on the field and proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction applies with every reaction

Xiangling using guoba on electro slimes shows each guoba tick reducing cd by 1 s.

**Evidence**

Xingqiu using his swords to reduce cd by 1s on electro slimes.

**Evidence**

### But if the 4TF holder is not on the field but proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction does not go through.

**Evidence**

In the video you can see that at roughly 2.33s into the video guoba is summoned with 11.9s CD.

2 overloads occur \(at 4s and 6s\)

At 8s into the video xiangling is switched back in and guoba has a 6.2s CD

In total, roughly 5.33s has passed and guoba has only gone down in 5.7s

2s has not been reduced and the 0.37s can be equated to just human error in measuring timings.

This result also confirmed by Lix-\#3417 using Barbara E and then switching to keqing, no CD reduction occurred.

**Significance**

4TF holders who trigger reactions while not on the field will not get the 1s CDR.

## Summons are Not Dynamic and Snapshot on Cast

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/-utEL05jfDg](https://youtu.be/-utEL05jfDg)

Oz's damage with no Bennett's Ult: 1695 \(no crit\), 2879 \(crit\)

Oz's damage with Bennett's Ult: 2180 \(no crit\), 3705 \(crit\)

We know that Bennett's ATK buff refreshes, and thus if Oz was Dynamic, Fischl would need to stay inside the AOE in order to obtain Bennett's ATK buff. However even when Fischl exits \(and thus losing ATK buff\), Oz's damage remains the same.

**Significance:** All buffs are not applied to summon\(s\) if you cast the buffs AFTER the summon\(s\) is already on the field.

### Re-snapshot: Resummoning Oz while he's still active re-snaphots Oz based on Fischl's buffs

Submitted by: JarJarThinks\#5411

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/61GvXHVc0D8](https://youtu.be/61GvXHVc0D8)

**Significance:**

This means that you can potentially update Oz's snapshot to reflect any new buffs, however this also means that if you resummon Oz after losing buffs, Oz will become weaker if he was previously snapshotted with buffs.

## Bow Users can use Aim Cancel

Added 11/19/2020

To perform an aim cancel, after performing a normal attack string, double tap "R" or your aimed shot button.

When done correctly, this has potentially the fastest known way to perform animation cancelling, faster than even jump/hop cancels.

I haven't seen anyone so far mention this outside the usual jump cancel or dash cancel, and it may be helpful to bow carries perform their role more effectively with their normal attacks.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/5dwCpSyuxxw?t=23](https://youtu.be/5dwCpSyuxxw?t=23)

**Significance:**

Consider using aim cancelling for your DPS bow users, this would potentially up Childe and Fischl's DPS as main carry with the bow.

## Animation Cancel

Date of Submission: 12/28/2020

**Finding:**

AA-LMB hold outperforms AARR for Fischl

**Evidence:**

I will be using 2 videos to draw this conclusion, one per animation cancel type. For AARR, Youtuber TenTen demonstrates an AARR chain from his video on the cryo regisvine: [https://youtu.be/ydl9a01bRjM?t=5](https://youtu.be/ydl9a01bRjM?t=5)

One important thing should be noted here: The recording starts while he is already at max attack speed, meaning that this is at least probably the 2nd attack string. I'm not sure if there is any literature that references this, but there's a "higher attack count = attack faster" mechanic in this game. I'm not sure if it's related to just the attack count, enemy stagger/composure, or a combination of both.

TenTen scores 7 full combos in 5.5s

\(64.1% + 68.0% + 22% \* 2\) = 176.1% total MV per combo

\(176.1%\*7\)/5.5 = 224% MV per second.

In this video [https://i.imgur.com/rqX2Z5M.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/rqX2Z5M.mp4), I score 7 full combos \(with some misses\) from scratch in ~7.3s, but they include an additional aimed shot per combo.

\(64.1% + 68.0% + 22% \* 2+63.9\) = 240% MV per combo

\(240%7\)/7.3 = 230% MV per second

despite the difference seemingly being around 2.5% more damage dealt, the latter combo outperforms the former for qualitative and quantitative reasons.

**Qualitative:** In my experience, it's easier to pull off while dodging and in practice \(should be tested and verified as a general claim\). The headshot staggering enemies will allow you to avoid more damage as well.

**Quantitative:** The samples used to compare the combos had different conditions, in terms of danger and pre-accumulated attack speed. During the last section of my video, you can notice I am attacking faster than at the beginning. Specifically, I counted 108 frames i.e. 1.8s for 2 full combos, which yields a 240%2/1.8 = 266.7% MV/s , which would be a more fair number to compare to TenTen's, given the similarity in attack speed. Also the headshot is a guaranteed crit that can keep the prototype crescent up.

**Significance:**

Overall better animation cancel for AA fischl found.

## Can Sucrose's Normal Attacks \(and by extension, Swirl reactions\) trigger Fischl's Lightning Smite?

Submitted by: Cola\#6861

I was asked this question on reddit and thought it should be the case since Sucrose' basic attacks are anemo which will swirl the electro debuff on the enemy.

Upon testing, as expected: it works, and yes Lightning Smite also crits!

**Evidence:**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyykxzJySIk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyykxzJySIk&feature=youtu.be)

**Significance:**

One more reason to get Sucrose out in the field more often, at least for this use case
