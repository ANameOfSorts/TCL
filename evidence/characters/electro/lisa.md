## Lisa's Press E Bounces

**Finding:** Lisa's Press E variant of Violet Arc's Innate Bouncing Effect

The description of Violet Arc clearly states that "opponents in a small AoE" are additionally stacked with a Conductive Stack, and this is true, but, it does not mention that the small radius can chain with affected opponents. Mobs hit via the initial "small radius" outputted by her Press E also output the same radius, and those in its radius also get stacked, including the initial conductor.

**Evidence:**

* [Showcase of the bounce being conducted once between 2 enemies](https://youtu.be/10QqWDgefpU) 2 : 2 Stacks
* [Showcase of the bounce being conducted in a mass of enemies](https://youtu.be/t8SdGCkJ1lM)

In the 'Mass' clip, one of the five Hilichurls only gained 1 Stack due to it aligning with only 1 radius, while the others had aligned in multiple radii, resulting in them gaining multiple stacks.

**Significance:** Lisa can easily abuse this knowledge in tightly packed groups to quickly and efficiently stack her Conductive Stacks. This allows for smoother and more rapid gameplay. Also, with the inclusion of C1, Lisa can efficiently recharge her Elemental Burst given a group of enemies whenever she is on-field.
