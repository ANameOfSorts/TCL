## Lisa's Press E Bounces

**Finding:** Lisa's Press E variant of Violet Arc's Innate Bouncing Effect

The description of Violet Arc clearly states that "opponents in a small AoE" are additionally stacked with a Conductive Stack, and this is true, but, it does not mention that the small radius can chain with affected opponents. Mobs hit via the initial "small radius" outputted by her Press E also output the same radius, and those in its radius also get stacked, including the initial conductor.

**Evidence:**

* [Showcase of the bounce being conducted once between 2 enemies](https://youtu.be/10QqWDgefpU) 2 : 2 Stacks
* [Showcase of the bounce being conducted in a mass of enemies](https://youtu.be/t8SdGCkJ1lM)

In the 'Mass' clip, one of the five Hilichurls only gained 1 Stack due to it aligning with only 1 radius, while the others had aligned in multiple radii, resulting in them gaining multiple stacks.

**Significance:** Lisa can easily abuse this knowledge in tightly packed groups to quickly and efficiently stack her Conductive Stacks. This allows for smoother and more rapid gameplay. Also, with the inclusion of C1, Lisa can efficiently recharge her Elemental Burst given a group of enemies whenever she is on-field.

## Lisa C1 Explanation

**Finding:** Lisa's C1 Miscommunication

Lisa's C1 has a false and misleading description. "Lisa recovers 2 Energy for every opponent hit while holding Violet Arc. A maximum of 10 Energy can be regenerated in this manner at any one time."

It also alters the Press E variant of Violet Arc as well as the Hold variant.

When, in actuality, it could be better stated as: "Lisa recovers 2 Energy for every opponent hit while pressing and connecting Violet Arc in its total Area of Effect. She also recovers 2 Energy for every opponent hit connecting a held Violet Arc. A maximum of 10 Energy can be regenerated in these manners at any one time."

The energy gained is not affected by Lisa's ER and, as it implies, cannot be transferred to other units. Theoretically, Lisa, with C1, can gain roughly 10 energy a second given the right situations.

**Evidence:**

* Energy is provided directly to Lisa in a delay after an enemy is hit with Violet Arc
* If Lisa is not present in the field before Energy is to be provided to Lisa, it will have no effect
* Energy gained through this is unaffected by ER%

[Example of its true elusive effectiveness](https://youtu.be/FSR7y-RcK3Y) \(Clip has Solo Lisa at +0% ER\)

**Significance:** 

Clears up how Lisa's C1 actually works. In knowing how C1 actually works, Lisa, when he is on-field, can effectively run much less ER on her gear and still recharge her Elemental Burst off CD given enough enemies/grouping. C1 is a strong constellation for on-field Lisa.
