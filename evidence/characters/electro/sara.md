  * [No ATK buff](https://youtu.be/_vT-ZlQmqc8)
  * [Successful ATK buff](https://youtu.be/gC1d89Jmd9c), does not require getting hit by bolts.

* Both Titanbreaker and Stormcluster damage is snapshot on Burst cast. - [Nass008#8577](https://imgur.com/skAgh1K)
* Sara's energy drain after burst cast occurs very late into her animation, meaning she can't be pre-funneled - Nass008#8577
