**Finding:**  
The buff provided by Sucrose's Constellation 6 (granting party members a 20% Elemental DMG Bonus based on which element is absorbed by Sucrose's burst) lasts for 10 seconds.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNVnsEdh29c

The first test in the video establishes that the Sucrose in question has her Constellation 6 active, and that the buff arrows on Sucrose correspond to a 20% Pyro DMG Bonus from her burst absorbing Pyro from Guoba.

The second test shows that, as soon as Sucrose's Elemental Burst absorbs Pyro, Sucrose gets buffed, which lasts for 10 seconds.

The third test shows that even a late absorption of Pyro still results in a 10 second buff.

**Significance:**  
Teams with C6 Sucrose can plan their absorption time around when they want to utilize her 10 second buff window, either for snapshotting or for general team  rotations.
