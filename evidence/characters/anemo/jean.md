# Jean

## Jean's C4 verticality

**By:** Special\#1775  
**Added:** 11/24/2020

**Findings:**

Jean's fourth constellation has the following effect:
<br/>_"Within the Field created by Dandelion Breeze, all opponents have their Anemo RES decreased by 40%."_
<br/>The Anemo Resistance reduction component of this constellation still applies vertically even if her Elemental Burst misses enemies on Venti's Elemental Burst

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

The reach of Dandelion Breeze's damage component has a vertical limit but the effects of it can reach much further. Thus, has potential combination for Xiao midair strikes.

## Gale Blade's Pull effect's Dependence on Level Difference

**By:** Michael/mSoo\#1561

**Theory:**

Tested this with Jean level by level. For Gale Blade to continually be able to pull opponents, it seems a level difference below or equal to 20 is required.

**Evidence:**
* [Lvl 74 Jean vs lvl 95 Hillichurl, where target Hilichurl isn't lifted](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765191980115689542/794809136244195339/unknown.png)
* [Lvl 75 Jean vs lvl 95 Hillichurl, where target Hilichurl is lifted](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765191980115689542/794809333057454091/unknown.png)

**Significance:**

Leveling your Jean to 80 is necessary if you want to abuse fall damage on Level 100 enemies on Floor 12 of Spiral Abyss

## Fall Damage Basis from Gale Blade

**By:** Wrax\#7777  
**Added:** 12/1/2020

**Theory:**

The damage caused by Jean's Elemental Skill, Gale Blade, from falling is a percent based on the target maximum health. These percentage value ranges are based on velocity of the fall rather than the height.

**Evidence:**

For the two below clips, we are comparing the damages dealt for simply pulling them to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack, and for when they are flung high up in the air with Jean's Elemental Skill.
* [Lvl 69 Hilichurl](https://youtu.be/fG90rk8K6-U) 
  * Damage of 2.2k, for pulling the target to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack
  * Damage of 2.1k, for flinging the target high up in the air with Gale Blade
* [Lvl 70 Fatui Cicin Mage](https://youtu.be/EYO5-SCBH7Q) 13.4k, 12.5k
  * Damage of 13.4k, for pulling the target to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack
  * Damage of 12.5k, for flinging the target high up in the air with Gale Blade

In the clip below, the second time Gale Blade is used, the target flew and was thrown at a slight arc rather than straight up. This resulted in reduced damage.
* [Lvl 90 Fatui Cicin Mage \(in Midsummer domain\)](https://youtu.be/v0ShwTzt9Fg)
  * Damage of 39.4k, for pulling the target to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack
  * Damage of 22.9k, for flinging the target at an arc with Gale Blade

I believe that the large gap in damage is sufficient evidence to claim that the slam/fall damage is a percentage based on the target's maximum health. Damage isn't boosted by Superconduct.
* [Evidence that its based on max hp](https://youtu.be/B1a3mCpDGkc)
  * Damage of 57k in the beginning when target had full hp 
  * Damage of 53k at the end when target had only a sliver of health

~[Rough eyeballing based on the hp bar seems to be 20 to 25% damage](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550599335524564993/781347956174487582/max_hp_eyeball.png)~

**Significance:**
* Pulling the target to the ground using Gale Blade rather than launching them results in similar damage applied faster.
* If choosing to launch target for crowd-control reasons, then make sure that the target is sent straight up in order to inflict the most damage.

## Continuous Self-Swirl and Cleanse

**By:** KDacus\#2865
<br/>**Added:** 3/21/2021

**Findings:**

Jean's Elemental Burst, Dandelion Breeze, repeatedly Swirls every character in the area if they have an Aura element on them. Should the same character stand on Bennett's Elemental Burst, Fantastic Voyage, it will trigger a Swirl reaction every second and apply Pyro to all surrounding enemies.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

Very consistent aura application. Can be used for Cryo or Hydro main carries or Overload setups in conjunction with Bennett.
