## Multiple E Skill Resonance can hit 1 target

By: The CEO of GEO\#7227

**Findings:** Resonating Geo Constructs with overlapping AoEs will multi-hit enemies

**Evidence:** [https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousAstuteWolfTriHard](https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousAstuteWolfTriHard)

**Significance:** Geo MC can make the most constructs on the game \(2 Meatballs which cap to 3 with Zhong Pillar, and 4 from Ult which don't count towards cap. This can turn small arenas into multi-hitting funzones.

**Note:**This entry is in Zhongli's evidence page as well.

## Twins CA MV's comparison

**Theory:** Lumine is better than Aether because her CA 2nd hit multiplier is higher.

**Evidence:** Attached will be 2 images of T6 AA talent pages. The first will be Aether and the second will be Lumine. Using these values, and counting frames, I found that Aether has higher MV/s on N1, N2, N3, and N1C than Lumine but less on every other AA combo. My findings are in this sheet: [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14WkH2fd3fvGpHjGO7_A8xCJTy92WZsq0SL-tfEqXoXw/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:** Although, I wouldn't recommend using AA for either MC, Aether comes out on top with shorter AA combos which would be more preferred combos anyway. This means that while Lumine has on multiplier higher than Aether's, her AA is still worse than that of Aether. It really shouldn't matter unless you play main DPS though, so play who you want.
