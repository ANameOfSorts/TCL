**Significance:**
Geo MC can make the most constructs on the game (2 Meatballs which cap to 3 with Zhong Pillar, and 4 from Ult which don't count towards cap. This can turn small arenas into multi-hitting funzones.

## Geo Traveller “Boulder Melt” with Albedo E 

(Zakharov#5645)

**Finding:**

Geo MC's boulder explodes for double damage when placed on top of the flower from Albedo's E.

**Evidence:** 

In this video, the boulder placed atop the E explodes immediately and does 2681 damage, while the boulder not placed on Albedo's E does 1306 damage. My Geo MC has 50% crit damage, so it's not because of a crit.

**Significance:** 

With a total of 844% talent scaling at level 9 and a 6 second cooldown (taking into account the free constellations on MC) this makes it a very significant damage source available to anyone with Albedo.
