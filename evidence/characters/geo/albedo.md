**Finding:**  
Albedo's E AoE is cylindrical and has a maximum height just over the elevator's height.

**Evidence:**  
Linked video showcases different flower positions on a wall and confirming if Albedo's E will proc. Attached Screenshot shows relative distance from a shadow on the wall.

There was no point where it was possible to proc E underneath the flower versus on the outermost part of the AoE supporting that it is Cylindrical and not Spherical.

**Significance:**  
It is possible to place Albedo's flower in an elevated position to avoid it getting destroyed.

**Further Testing:**  
I've experienced placing Albedo's flower on top of Electro Hypostasis' summons during its death phase and it remained suspended after the summon was destroyed. This may be replicated in Albedo + Zhong teams with Zhong's pillar however I cannot test this as I do not own Zhong.
