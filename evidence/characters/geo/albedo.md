## Dimensions of Albedo’s Elemental Skill AoE

**Finding:**  
Albedo's E AoE is cylindrical and has a maximum height just over the elevator's height.

**Evidence:**   
Linked video showcases different flower positions on a wall and confirming if Albedo's E will proc. Attached Screenshot shows relative distance from a shadow on the wall.

There was no point where it was possible to proc E underneath the flower versus on the outermost part of the AoE supporting that it is Cylindrical and not Spherical.

**Significance:**   
It is possible to place Albedo's flower in an elevated position to avoid it getting destroyed.

**Further Testing:**  
I've experienced placing Albedo's flower on top of Electro Hypostasis' summons during its death phase and it remained suspended after the summon was destroyed. This may be replicated in Albedo + Zhong teams with Zhong's pillar however I cannot test this as I do not own Zhong.

## Geo Traveller “Boulder Melt” with Albedo E 

By: Zakharov\#5645

**Finding:**   
Geo MC's boulder explodes for double damage when placed on top of the flower from Albedo's E

**Evidence:**  
 In this video, the boulder placed atop the E explodes immediately and does 2681 damage, while the boulder not placed on Albedo's E does 1306 damage. My Geo MC has 50% crit damage, so it's not because of a crit.

**Significance:**   
With a total of 844% talent scaling at level 9 and a 6 second cooldown \(taking into account the free constellations on MC\) this makes it a very significant damage source available to anyone with Albedo
