### How does 2NO interact with Noelle Q? \(Kibouo\#1698\)

Added 12/18/2020

**Hypothesis:**

* 2NO gives +20% burst damage
* Noelle's enhanced basic attacks count as elemental burst. Thus 2NO should increase her damage during her ult's duration.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/IH-g6ek-wdo](https://youtu.be/IH-g6ek-wdo) - Noelle with NO

[https://youtu.be/Pq8qZ7mC-JU](https://youtu.be/Pq8qZ7mC-JU) - Noelle w/o NO

**Result:**
The only swing affected by NO is the one initiated by the ult. Interestingly, the activation of the ult creates a "shockwave" which does damage \(1st damage number in attached vids\). This damage is also affected by NO. Enhanced basic attacks are not affected by NO.

### How does Noelleâ€™s Elemental burst interact with temporary defence buffs? \(Midori\#2173, JonahFarc\#7056\)

**Finding:**
Noelle's Elemental Burst snapshots the current defence value at the time of activation for the ATK increase.

**Evidence:**
Burst was activated then a ATK value of 3,534 was observed. This value did not increase after 235 DEF was applied with a food buff.[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6ACTJdKYS4)

**Significance:**

This means that users of whiteblind needs to keep the stack at max or stack it before activating burst for full value of the active effect.

### Does Noelle's C4 snapshot attack when Breastplate is cast or when the shield breaks? \(JonahFarc\#7056\)

**Finding:**
It takes the ATK value when it breaks.

**Evidence:**
Activated a shield without burst and had it break with burst, then one vice versa. The damage on the shield break when burst was active was higher.

**Significance:**
Break your shield while your burst is active if possible.

## How does Sacrificial Greatsword work with Noelle? \(JonahFarc\#7056\)

**Finding:**
Sacrificial can proc on either activation or the pop from C4. If reactivated while shield is already active, the first shield is replaced and you do not get the C4 pop.

**Evidence:**
Hit Lawachurl with C4 pop and cooldown reset. Hit Ruin Guard with a double E from Sacrificial and didn't get the C4 pop.

**Significance:**
If you're C4, use the sacrificial reset after the shield pops, not while it's active.
