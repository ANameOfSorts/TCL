### How does 2NO interact with Noelle Q? \(Kibouo\#1698\)

Added 12/18/2020

**Hypothesis:**

* 2NO gives +20% burst damage
* Noelle's enhanced basic attacks count as elemental burst. Thus 2NO should increase her damage during her ult's duration.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/IH-g6ek-wdo](https://youtu.be/IH-g6ek-wdo) - Noelle with NO

[https://youtu.be/Pq8qZ7mC-JU](https://youtu.be/Pq8qZ7mC-JU) - Noelle w/o NO

**Result:** The only swing affected by NO is the one initiated by the ult. Interestingly, the activation of the ult creates a "shockwave" which does damage \(1st damage number in attached vids\). This damage is also affected by NO. Enhanced basic attacks are not affected by NO.

### How does Noelleâ€™s Elemental burst interact with temporary defence buffs? \(Midori\#2173, JonahFarc\#7056\)

**Finding:** Noelle's Elemental Burst snapshots the current defence value at the time of activation for the ATK increase.

**Evidence:** Burst was activated then a ATK value of 3,534 was observed. This value did not increase after 235 DEF was applied with a food buff.[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6ACTJdKYS4)

**Significance:**

This means that users of whiteblind needs to keep the stack at max or stack it before activating burst for full value of the active effect.

### Does Noelle's C4 snapshot attack when Breastplate is cast or when the shield breaks? \(JonahFarc\#7056\)

**Finding:** It takes the ATK value when it breaks.

**Evidence:** Activated a shield without burst and had it break with burst, then one vice versa. The damage on the shield break when burst was active was higher.

**Significance:** Break your shield while your burst is active if possible.

## How does Sacrificial Greatsword work with Noelle? \(JonahFarc\#7056\)

**Finding:** Sacrificial can proc on either activation or the pop from C4. If reactivated while shield is already active, the first shield is replaced and you do not get the C4 pop.

**Evidence:** Hit Lawachurl with C4 pop and cooldown reset. Hit Ruin Guard with a double E from Sacrificial and didn't get the C4 pop. [https://youtu.be/gPMwZswv-y4](https://youtu.be/gPMwZswv-y4)

**Significance:** If you're C4, use the sacrificial reset after the shield pops, not while it's active.

## maidstrike vs n3d (dragonstrike)

**Theory:**
Noelle using N1P spam (hitlag plunge aka Dragon Strike Noelle) is higher damage per second than the N3 dash cancel.

To execute the hitlag plunge, attack an enemy and dash and jump at the same time as when your sword collides with the enemy. She will gain more height than normal enough to execute a low plunge. 

**Evidence:**

With Anemo Resonance
N1 + plunge spam = 207.36% MV/s
N3 Sprint cancel    = 153.09% MV/s  (credit Artesian)

With Jean C2
N1 + plunge spam = 207.36% MV/s
N3 Sprint cancel   = 162.66% MV/s  (WITH jean C2)
N3 + plunge is:  187.93 MV/s (also with jean C2)

**Summary:**
So by using the dragon strike technique on noelle with Jean C2, you will see around a 27.4% increase in dps over just spamming N3 dash cancels (also with Jean C2). And with some more practice you could definitely shave off more frames with the increased attack speed as shown by the 89 frame N1P the lowest I was able to get. I'd say the average N1 + plunge is 96 frames. 

Question: Why don't you have a version without Anemo resonance? Anemo characters are shit to run with Noelle.

Me: I can't for the life of me get consistent plunges on these boomer hands without anemo res. I whiff more than I succeed, and if it's not consistent for me, then it's not realistic to me. If you can do it without move speed then, by all means. You can also use anything that gives you move speed. Doesn't have to be anemo res. Personally i just dont believe its worth doing atm, until we hav a good move speed buffer that doesn't gimp the comp. Tested with macros, even with macros I couldn't get consistent plunges without some form of move speed buff.
