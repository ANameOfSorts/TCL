## Kaeya A4 procs on frozen targets

**By:** JonahFarc\#7056

**Findings:** Kaeya's A4 is phrased as "Opponents Frozen by **Frostgnaw** will drop additional Elemental Particles." However, enemies don't actually have to be frozen by his elemental skill ****for the additional particles to be generated; as long as Kaeya's skill hits a frozen enemy, it will generate additional elemental particles.

**Evidence:** [Barbara freezes target and Kaeya uses his E afterwards. 4 particles are received, which can only come from his A4 passive.](https://youtu.be/RiTTnpQ44DA)

**Significance:** With freeze comps, you can basically just E whenever you want and still get the additional particles without having to make sure Kaeya's the trigger
