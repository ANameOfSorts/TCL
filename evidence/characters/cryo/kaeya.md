**Findings:**
Kaeya's A4 can proc on an already frozen target

**Evidence:**
[Barbara freezes target and Kaeya uses his E afterwards. 4 particles are received, which can only come from his A4 passive.](https://youtu.be/RiTTnpQ44DA)

**Significance:**
With freeze comps, you can basically just E whenever you want and still get the additional particles without having to make sure Kaeya's the trigger
