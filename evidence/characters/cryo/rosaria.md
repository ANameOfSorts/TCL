## A4 Stacks with External Sources of CRIT

**By:** The Immersive Fish\#9373  
**Added:** 04/09/2021

**Finding:** Rosaria's Crit Rate Sharing is influenced by other direct Crit boosters.

This has been tested to work with Hu Tao's A1 and Geo MC's C1.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/TmSbqoUg0k0](https://youtu.be/TmSbqoUg0k0)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Stats" %}
Diona : 29.9%  
Rosaria A4 : + 8.8%

Diona w/ Rosaria A4 : 38.7%  
Diona w/ Hu Tao A1 : 41.9%
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

While the Hu Tao boost is active, Ulting with Rosaria increases Diona's CR to **52.5%** meaning that Rosaria's A4 is giving Diona **10.6%** CR. This is an **additional 1.8% CR** when compared to the crit sharing uninfluenced by Hu Tao.

**Significance:** This confirms that anything which influences a characters crit stats found in the details tab will influence the Crit Sharing which Rosaria offers

## Rosaria's C6 Debuff Refreshes on Hit

**By:** Zendaju\#3064  
**Added:** 04/15/2021

**Finding:** Rosaria's C6 debuff is also triggered by the DoT on her burst.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831212714416144434/831214571913347112/Genshin_Impact_2021-04-12_11-51-59_Trim.mp4)

**Significance:** The description is misleading, and you can actually maintain 100% uptime on this physical resistance shred.

## Pale Flame on Rosaria

**By:** Monado\#9922

[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836853492396195871/838339076746117120/transcript-pale-flame-on-rosaria.html)

**Finding:** 2 stacks of the Pale Flame 4 piece set effect cannot be achieved by 1 use of Rosaria's skill despite the skill being 2 hits \(probably because the 2 hits are within 0.3s\), and requires back to back usage to achieve the full 4 piece effect.

**Evidence:** [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPQqnZv0qLk)  
Also hitlag on Mitachurl shields [wooden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jd4QWFFavY) and [geo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klxD_F9Widg) still only grants you one stack per skill use.

**Significance:** This makes 4 piece Pale Flame stacks somewhat difficult to maintain for carry Rosaria with, since her skill CD is 6s and Pale Flame stacks last for 7s.
