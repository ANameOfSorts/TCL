* Rosaria's Q applies 1A cryo every damage tick with [no ICD](https://imgur.com/jwQ4MTn)
* Rosaria's crit bonus from her A1 is included in her [A4 crit sharing](https://imgur.com/Gvmc6pN)

```python
Rosaria : 50.3%
Venti   : 42.3%

50.3% + 12% = 62.3%

Rosaria : 62.3%

62.3% * 0.15 = 9.345%
42.3% + 9.345 = 51.645%

Venti   : 51.7%
```

* Rosaria's A1 crit bonus doesn't apply if you use her E while already [behind an enemy](https://imgur.com/Ye5ro0C)
