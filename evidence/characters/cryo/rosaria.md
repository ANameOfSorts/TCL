# Rosaria

## A4 Stacks with External Sources of CRIT

**By:** The Immersive Fish\#9373  
**Added:** 04/09/2021

**Finding:** Rosaria's Crit Rate Sharing is influenced by other direct Crit boosters.

This has been tested to work with Hu Tao's A1 and Geo MC's C1.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/TmSbqoUg0k0](https://youtu.be/TmSbqoUg0k0)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Stats" %}

Diona      : 29.9%  
Rosaria A4 : + 8.8%

Diona w/ Rosaria A4 : 38.7%  
Diona w/ Hu Tao A1  : 41.9%

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

While the Hu Tao boost is active, Ulting with Rosaria increases Diona's CR to **52.5%** meaning that Rosaria's A4 is giving Diona **10.6%** CR. This is an **additional 1.8% CR** when compared to the crit sharing uninfluenced by Hu Tao. 

**Significance:** This confirms that anything which influences a characters crit stats found in the details tab will influence the Crit Sharing which Rosaria offers
