## A4 Stacks with External Sources of CRIT

**By:** The Immersive Fish\#9373

**Finding:** Rosaria's Crit Rate Sharing is influenced by other direct Crit boosters.

This has been tested to work with Hu Tao's A1 and Geo MC's C1.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/TmSbqoUg0k0](https://youtu.be/TmSbqoUg0k0)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Stats" %}
Diona : 29.9%  
Rosaria A4 : + 8.8%

Diona w/ Rosaria A4 : 38.7%  
Diona w/ Hu Tao A1  : 41.9%
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

While the Hu Tao boost is active, Ulting with Rosaria increases Diona's CR to **52.5%** meaning that Rosaria's A4 is giving Diona **10.6%** CR. This is an **additional 1.8% CR** when compared to the crit sharing uninfluenced by Hu Tao.

**Significance:** This confirms that anything which influences a characters crit stats found in the details tab will influence the Crit Sharing which Rosaria offers

## Rosaria's C6 Debuff Refreshes on Hit

**Finding:** Rosaria's C6 debuff is also triggered by the DoT on her burst.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831212714416144434/831214571913347112/Genshin_Impact_2021-04-12_11-51-59_Trim.mp4)

**Significance:** The description is misleading, and you can actually maintain 100% uptime on this physical resistance shred.
