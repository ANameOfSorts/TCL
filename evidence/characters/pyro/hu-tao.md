**Findings:**  
1. Hutao does reset the BB duration with her CA. Due to this, hit lag also "extend" the duration of BB quite significantly  
2. Her CA, however, does not reset the BB tick timer  
3. Her BB does not snapshot and can crit

[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/c7DzOY8.jpg) At 00;03;06: I first applied BB  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/A02CDlE.jpg) At 00;06;13: I reapplied BB for the 1st time  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/4oywcDb.jpg) At 00;07;17: BB tick for the 1st time. It was non-crit. (Also, its DMG wasn't 1846, it was 880 that popped right under the 1846)  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/R4udWmE.jpg) At 00;07;24: I reapplied BB for the 2nd time  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/KBWABMa.jpg) At 00;09;06, I reapplied BB for the 3rd time  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/YEWeDRO.jpg) At 00;10;25: I reapplied BB for the 4th time  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/olENR8F.jpg) At 00;12;01: BB tick for the 2nd time. It was a crit  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/UNW3by4.jpg) At 00;15;28: BB tick for the 3rd time. The DMG was reduced because Hutao was no longer in Paramita Papilio (PP), also non-crit  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/njU9MXZ.jpg) At 00;19;29: BB tick for the 4th. Same DMG as above, without PP and non-crit  
[Image.](https://i.imgur.com/1k15rzd.jpg) At 00;20;04: BB ended. Approximately 9s after i reapplied it at 00;10;25

**Significance:**  
Commissioned by @gimmeabreak.  
Also, if you reset BB right before your PP duration end, you can have a maximum of 4 BB tick for 1 PP activation.
