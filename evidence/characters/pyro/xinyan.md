## Xinyan's Burst Procs Sac GS with C2

**By:** Neptunya\#8291

**Finding:** The shield C2 Xinyan creates on burst can proc Sac GS's passive.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/Q\_5qqGYf8DI](https://youtu.be/Q_5qqGYf8DI)

**Significance:** More chances for sacrificial procs never hurts. Also, there's less worry if you want to pop skill when sac GS is on CD or if the passive doesn't proc at all, because burst can also proc sac GS if your Xinyan is C2.

**Finding:**  
Xinyan C6 affects her Skill and Burst. The un-game description for Xinyan's C6 states that “Xinyan's Charged Attacks gain an ATK bonus equal to 50% of her DEF.” However, the buff is simply added to the stats page as flat attack. Since Xinyan’s elemental skill and burst are dynamic, C6 buff can increase their damage.  

**Evidence:**

* [C6 dynamically buffing Burst DoT ticks and C2 Shield DoT ticks](https://youtu.be/5oh5md4EofY)  

**Significance:**  
In-game description is pepega and on-field C6 Xinyan will do a tiny bit more damage than expected.
