**Finding:** 4TF Xiangling and C2 Chongyun can result in 2 Guobas being deployed at the same time.

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDHZhkOwGk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDHZhkOwGk8)

**Significance:** It's possible to get 100%+ guoba uptime on Xiangling using 4TF. This also shows that there is nothing in the game preventing multiple Goubas from being summoned. This is unlikely to ever be optimal, but that wasn't the point of testing this.

**Finding:** The hitbox of Xiangling's ultimate can hit more than once per rotation by manipulating self and enemy positioning.

**Evidence:**

[12 ult hits when standing still against ruin guard \(no hitbox extensions\)](https://youtu.be/CV01mRP-oZA)

[15+ ult hits when enemy extends their hitboxes and some small movement](https://youtu.be/sBW6qrqfs_E?t=10)

[15+ ult hits when using charged attacks to displace ult](https://youtu.be/PWpTYNlnIic?t=10)

[Dashing through with ultimate changes clockwise rotation to anti-clockwise on some hits \(first hit notably in below video\)](https://youtu.be/oILW9mK8neQ)

**Significance:** It is possible to significantly boost the total damage of Xiangling's ultimate \(&gt;25%\) by moving in specific patterns and utilizing enemy hitboxes to get more hits in per ult.
