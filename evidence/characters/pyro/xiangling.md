# Guoba CDR interaction

**Finding:** 
4TF Xiangling and C2 Chongyun can result in 2 Guobas being deployed at the same time  
Credit to Risuke#6743 for suggesting this idea to me

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDHZhkOwGk8

**Significance:** it's possible to get 100%+ guoba uptime on xl using 4tf set. But tbh, this will probably never be optimal unless you're just tryna have fun
