**Finding:** 4TF Xiangling and C2 Chongyun can result in 2 Guobas being deployed at the same time.

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDHZhkOwGk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDHZhkOwGk8)

**Significance:** It's possible to get 100%+ guoba uptime on Xiangling using 4TF. This also shows that there is nothing in the game preventing multiple Goubas from being summoned. This is unlikely to ever be optimal, but that wasn't the point of testing this.
