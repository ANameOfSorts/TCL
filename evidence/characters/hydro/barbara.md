**By:** RoaringMeow\#2437  
**Added:** 12/19/2020

**Finding:**

Reducing Barbara E animation for optimizing the "first heal"

**Evidence:**

* Just Switch: [https://youtu.be/8d4SAxy2yrM](https://youtu.be/8d4SAxy2yrM)  
* Just Switch and Beyond: [https://youtu.be/yBNpbQNPVgg](https://youtu.be/yBNpbQNPVgg)

**Significance**

A mechanic which is super useful to abuse the switch character cooldowns while using character's E between delays. So far I found only Barbara being able to do it consistently

Steps to Reproduce

* Switch to Barbara
* Press the button to swap to another character and immediately spam E
