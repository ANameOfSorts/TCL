## Plunge on Stairs in Floor 12

**Finding:**
Note: This finding was not my idea. It was originally posted in the #tips·and·tricks·chat via a reddit link and it
seemed good enough to be submitted to the library. However, I did some of my own testing and compiled my own thoughts on
this finding.

Using the stairs in the front and back of in floor 12, you can take advantage of the slightly elevated terrain to
perform a few dragonstrikes at a time.

**Evidence:**

Both of these videos showcase me using the stairs in the front and back area of f12 for dragonstrike.

My personal thoughts on this trick: I think players can take the most advantage of it until the end of this blessing and
possibly beyond. However, while I was messing around with Beidou I found it difficult for me to do the 4 strikes
consistently and the rotation of running back and forth on the stairs took me more than a few tries to get used to.

**Significance:**
With the current abyss blessing, enemy defense is shred by 40% upon the infliction of plunge attacks, making this trick
really nice for F12 :luminederp:  This trick may also be viable in later abysses (i.e 1.5 rotation) unless the structure
of F12 itself is changed.
