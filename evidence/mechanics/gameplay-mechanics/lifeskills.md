## Bush Droprates

**By:** gideleon1\#2188   
**Added:** 04/11/2021

**Finding:** There is an 8% chance to get something from a broken bush.

Out of 1,174 Bushes:

* 30 Lizards
* 32 Matsutakes
* 32 Eggs

It seems like the drop is chosen randomly. Testing was done during the day, because at night, fireflies are added to the pool. They do not replace anything in the loot table, because at night all four itesm were dropped. There has never been an instance of getting more than one drop out of a bush.

**Evidence:** [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mopokLcAiOwz9I7NS8LZnmNUhz57RStiXdyYN_yNc8/edit)

I didn't assume anyone would want a two hour video of me just breaking bushes, so I just compiled the results. 

**Significance:** Was curious about the drop rates, and I couldn't find anything about them in the TCL, online, or in the data gathering server, so I figured I'd just do it myself. I wanted exact percentages just for the sake of thoroughness.

## Destroy Function Mechanics

**Finding:**

The destroy button in the inventory is the only way to mass delete/destroy items in the game other than the Parametric Transformer. However, the function itself is limited and the resources gained from destroying items are not worth compared to using them as fodder.

**Evidence:** [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/qRB1FWr)

By destroying artifacts, you either can get XP or Mora, it is the same for each. By destroying weapons, you obtain a number of 1\* enhancement ores based on the rarity of the weapon \(3 for 3 stars, 2 for 2 stars, 1 for 1 star\)

**Other Observations:**

* 5\* or 4\* artifacts and weapons cannot be destroyed
* Refined 3\* weapons cannot be destroyed
* Character development materials, Food \(except apples and sunsettias\), gadgets, quest, and precious items cannot be destroyed
* Material items that can be destroyed \(in addition to apples and sunsettia\) do not give anything when destroyed
* Some material items can be destroyed and some cannot. There does not seem to be consistent reasoning for why

**Significance:**

Destroying weapons is not efficient and causes you to lose weapon XP. Destroying artifacts although has no "real downside," the rewards given are lackluster and are better used as fodder. There is no reason to destroy items that give no rewards. Those items are better used for the Parametric Transformer if they need to be disposed of. The only upside is to mass clear inventory space, but due to the size of the inventory and the loss of XP, it does not warrant using the feature.

### Resin to Stardust Exchange Comparison

**By:** Mateng

**Added:** 4/14/2021

**Findings**: Blue \(XP\) leylines are more stardust-efficient than Gold \(Mora\) leylines. They are 65.33 Stardust/Resin, while Gold leylines and Magic Crystal Ore conversion from the Blacksmiths are both 60 Stardust/Resin.

**Evidence:** [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kx4jvr/exchange_rate_math_of_resin_to_stardust_math_post/)

I used simple exchange rate math to relate XP materials, Magic Crystal Ores, and Mora to their cost in Resin, and back to their cost in the Stardust Shop. I assumed that the chance of receiving 6 or 7 Adv. Exp and 4 or 5 Hero's Wits was 50%.

**Significance:** These findings identify that the most efficient use of Stardust \(outside of buying the 10 Fates, if the Traveler wishes to pay for them\) is to clear the limited amount of Mora, then the Magic Crystal Ores, then the Adventurer's Experience. Additionally, it is more Resin-efficient to be farming more Blue leylines than Gold ones.
