## Multi Charge Skills Snapshot CDR
**By:** Kourinn\#6001
**Added:** 04/18/2021

**Findings:**
Multi-charge elemental skills (C0/C1 Xiao, C1 Sucrose, ...) snapshot cooldown reduction at the time the skill is cast, not the cooldown reduction at the time the next charge starts charging (or appears to from in-game UI). Additionally, held abilities (Jean E, Childe E, ...) use CDR at the time their cooldown starts, not on cast/hold start.

**Evidence:**
[Testing with Xiao and Chongyun C2](https://youtu.be/MB_IR0OStgA)

**Significance:**
CDR may be very beneficial for characters with multi-charge skills.
