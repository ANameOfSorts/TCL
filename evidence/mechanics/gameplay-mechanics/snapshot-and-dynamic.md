# Snapshot and Dynamic

## Summons are Not Dynamic and Snapshot on Cast

**Comfy’s Findings** \(Comfy Seaweed\#3841\)

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/-utEL05jfDg](https://youtu.be/-utEL05jfDg)

* Oz's damage with no Bennett's Ult: 1695 \(no crit\), 2879 \(crit\)
* Oz's damage with Bennett's Ult: 2180 \(no crit\), 3705 \(crit\)

We know that Bennett's ATK buff refreshes, and thus if Oz was Dynamic, Fischl would need to stay inside the AOE in order to obtain Bennett's ATK buff. However even when Fischl exits \(and thus losing ATK buff\), Oz's damage remains the same.

**Significance:** All buffs are not applied to summon\(s\) if you cast the buffs AFTER the summon\(s\) is already on the field.

**Plenair’s Findings** \(Pleinair\#8321\)

**Editor's Note:** The author did not submit an evidence/proof but accepted the entry as it is a very interesting take on the summons, that Xiangling Pyronado is counted in the same vein as Oz, a summon.

To add to Seaweed I tested this with Xiangling Pyronado along with c6 Diona Q. While its not that big of a surprise- pyronado shares the same attributes and acts as a summon therefore getting the 200 EM

**Significance:** Xiangling can take full advantage of Diona c6 200EM buff without having to be on the field with BOTH of her abilities. This is because both pyronado and gouba will get the 200 EM buff if summoned after Diona's Q. If running an XQ you can use dragonsbane on Xiangling to either: get extra damage on vaporize, **OR** get a higher multiplier on melt

## Re-snapshot: Resummoning Oz while he's still active re-snaphots Oz based on Fischl's buffs

**By:** JarJarThinks\#5411

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/61GvXHVc0D8](https://youtu.be/61GvXHVc0D8)

**Significance:** This means that you can potentially update Oz's snapshot to reflect any new buffs, however this also means that if you resummon Oz after losing buffs, Oz will become weaker if he was previously snapshotted with buffs.


## Stats not in details stat page are not snapshot

**Finding:**  
In general, stats that are not in a Character's "Details" pane do not snapshot. However, the exception is that "Increases All DMG" effects do snapshot, except for the exceptions to this exception: Alley Hunter and Geo Resonance don't snapshot their "Increases All DMG".

Another exception is that Ganyu's A1 "snapshots", because the Frostflake Arrow generated when A1 is active is a completely different internal object than the Frostflake Arrow generated when A1 is inactive. (Additionally, it's not just CA Crit Rate, because her uncharged CAs don't get the 20% CR buff).

**Signifiance:**  
More extensive knowledge on what does and does not snapshot.
