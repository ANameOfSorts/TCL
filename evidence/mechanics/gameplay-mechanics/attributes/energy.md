**Finding:** Energy recharge gained through auto attacking only applies to the character on field

**Evidence:** The original author didn't provide video evidence, but it was approved due to being easily replicated**.** Special thanks go to Pinupski\#9999 for validating this entry with video evidence.

* Setup: Enemy's health was depleted to ~5% and let to reset to full HP, removing the variable of HP particles
* [Autoattacking](https://youtu.be/yMstsGRLy5s): Used all bursts to reset the burst meter, then auto attacked with Zhongli until burst was charged
* [Conclusion](https://youtu.be/3W_Gjd5LfDM): Characters other than Zhongli still had 0 energy.

**Significance:** Off-field characters cannot gain energy via auto attacks from the active character.
