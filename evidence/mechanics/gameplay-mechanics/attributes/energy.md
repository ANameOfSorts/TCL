## Only On-Field Characters Gain Energy By Auto Attacks

**By:** c2authoritarian\#5277 and Pinupski

Updated: 4/3/2021

**Finding:** 
Energy recharge gained through auto attacking only applies to the character on field

**Evidence:** The original author didn't provide video evidence, but it was approved due to being easily replicated**.** Special thanks go to Pinupski
\#9999
 for validating this entry with video evidence.

1. Enemy's health was depleted to ~5% and let to reset to full HP, removing the variable of HP particles
2. [Autoattacking](https://youtu.be/yMstsGRLy5s): Used all bursts to reset the burst meter, then auto attacked with Zhongli until burst was charged
3. [Conclusion](https://youtu.be/3W_Gjd5LfDM): Characters other than Zhongli still had 0 energy.

**Significance:**
 Off-field characters cannot gain energy via auto attacks from the active character
.

## Energy Recharge **D**oes NOT Have a Softcap \(at least up to 300 ER\)

**By:** muakasan\#2792  
**Added:** 4/4/2021

**Evidence:**

1. Bennett was given 300.1% ER
2. Funneled non-pyro elemental particles to Bennett while off-field
3. [Took 33 particles](https://youtu.be/8WRgwQf-zh0), which is almost exactly what was expected

```python
0.6 energy per particle * 3.001 ER * 33 particles = 59.420
```

**Significance:** Helpful when figuring out how much energy recharge is needed to build on a character in a specific team.
