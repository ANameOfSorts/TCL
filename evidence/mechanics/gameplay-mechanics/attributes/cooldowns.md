## Multi Charge Skills Snapshot CDR

**By:** Kourinn\#6001   
**Added:** 04/18/2021

**Findings:** Multi-charge elemental skills \(C0/C1 Xiao, C1 Sucrose, ...\) snapshot cooldown reduction at the time the skill is cast, not the cooldown reduction at the time the next charge starts charging \(or appears to from in-game UI\). Additionally, held abilities \(Jean E, Childe E, ...\) use CDR at the time their cooldown starts, not on cast/hold start.

**Evidence:** [Testing with Xiao and Chongyun C2](https://youtu.be/MB_IR0OStgA)

**Significance:** CDR may be very beneficial for characters with multi-charge skills.

**Note:** The snapshotting ultimately does not matter for static sources of CDR, from gear, resonance, etc. The added benefit for multi-charge skills would be from on-demand sources like Chong, to be able to pop the CDR, blow your charges, and then not have to worry about the buff/field effect until your charges are back while retaining the reduced cooldown.
