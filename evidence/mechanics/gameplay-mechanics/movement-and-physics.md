While moving around Teyvat for whatever reason there will most likely come a time where you need to climb. Climbing takes both time and stamina. What if I told you there was a work around for the majority of climbs you may encounter during your travels? Well there is...

Finding:
After familiarizing myself with the technique of b-hopping in the first week of Genshins official release for the purpose of re-roll AR7 speedruns, this would quickly become my exclusive means of travel. This lead me to discovering an alternative faster method of scaling near vertical walls (without climbing at all).

Significance: 
Can make virtually any travel quicker, whether you're mob farming around your world, crystal farming or getting character ascension mats etc etc..
