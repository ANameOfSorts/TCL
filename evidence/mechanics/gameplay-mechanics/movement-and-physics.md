## Climbing without Climbing

**Finding:** After familiarizing myself with the technique of b-hopping in the first week of Genshin's official release for the purpose of re-roll AR7 speedruns, this would quickly become my exclusive means of travel. This led me to discover an alternative faster method of scaling near-vertical walls \(without climbing or consuming stamina at all\).

**Significance:** Can make virtually any travel quicker, whether you're mob farming around your world, crystal farming, or getting character ascension mats etc etc..

## Movement technique and player model comparisons

**Theory:** What is the fastest movement technique for both short distances and long distances? Do movement speed buffs produce non-linear scaling for different character model sizes?

**Significance**
The fastest movement technique for short distance is to chain dashes together with equal spacing between them with an adult male as they have biggest strides. This will ensure your dash has more up time then simply dash spamming.
For long distance you will do the same, dash chaining with maximum dash uptime on an adult male then switching to a teen male for the last dash of your stamina charge and chaining b-hops from there on.

A 10% movement speed buff does not cause b-hopping with other model types to be faster then a teen male with the same buff. However I am still yet to test 20%/20% effects although not expected to change either.
