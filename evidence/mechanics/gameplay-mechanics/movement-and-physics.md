**Finding:** After familiarizing myself with the technique of b-hopping in the first week of Genshin's official release for the purpose of re-roll AR7 speedruns, this would quickly become my exclusive means of travel. This led me to discover an alternative faster method of scaling near-vertical walls \(without climbing or consuming stamina at all\).

**Evidence:** 

* [Introduction to b-hopping by Arch- er](https://youtu.be/3bY_vUgHY_g)
* [Climbing without Climbing](https://youtu.be/n56JICDn1Eg)

**Significance:** Can make virtually any travel quicker, whether you're mob farming around your world, crystal farming, or getting character ascension mats etc etc..
