**Bug/Exploit:** You're able to use your overworld team \(regardless of character overlap with first half team\) for the second half of Spiral Abyss by selecting retry at the same time as killing the last mob.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/XW\_TDsyFkPA](https://youtu.be/XW_TDsyFkPA)

**Significance:** After you clear the second half it doesn't complete, it's unsure whether it would be possible to trick it to complete somehow. It could be useful for speedrun showcases or character highlights in abyss.

**Finding:** Energy Particles don't stop moving even when you open a pause menu. You can absorb particles while in a pause menu. 
Works in every menu most notably adventure book and wish menu allowing it to be used in abyss (paimonbukeyi/#4732).

**Evidence:** [Youtube](https://youtu.be/7H84lGcZf8s)

**Significance:** Allows characters to quickly absorb particles, reducing the time they are on-screen doing nothing, also reducing the chance they get hit.
