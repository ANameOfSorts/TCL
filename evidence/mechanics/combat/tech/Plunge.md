## Dash-Jump-Plunge

**Finding:**  
If you dash into enemy and jump at the same time, you can perform a plunging attack. This doesn't work against all enemies. Not all body types of player characters can do it.  

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
The only practical significance on this is yet another way to break Fatui Geo Chanter energy armour without claymore, Geo damage, or overload reactions;
since plunges do damage to it. Hard staggering an Abyss mage might be another use for this. This move also looks really cool to execute.
