## **How Elemental Shields having 250% Absorption Bonus to said element Work**

**By: TÃ¼rin\#8565**

**E/N: Submission demonstrates the above mentioned effect using the example of Diona but this also holds true for other similar character-generated shields.**

**Theory:**

With Cryo Absorption Bonus, Diona takes 2.5 points of Cryo Damage for every 1 point of Shield HP lost.

**Evidence:**

My original math is in the description of the video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk41KCMjfCI&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk41KCMjfCI&feature=youtu.be)

**Significance:**

Other shield effectiveness is not accounted for, but it stands to reason that they work the same way. We can both say that a shield has 2.5x of its current value, or the damage is reduced by 2.5x, against it's effective element.
