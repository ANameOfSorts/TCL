The [Genshin Impact Fandom Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Interruption_Resistance#Practice_Data) has tables of poise data tested in game.

## Theoretical Data

The [Genshin Impact Fandom Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Interruption_Resistance/Theoretical_Data) has tables on extrapolated values based off of the current running theory on poise. Actual gameplay may differ from the values there, as the theory is still evolving.

## Ec heavy hits stagger lock

**Finding:** 
Electro-charged + heavy hit instances can stagger lock.

**Evidence:** 
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsBwNPbN6lk)

1. Apply electro-charged and deal heavy hits to target
2. Stagger resistance will be reduced
3. A threshold will be met and allows electro-charged heavy hits to stun lock ruin guard

Applying electro-charged (EC) and dealing heavy hits (HH) on ruin guards appears to reduce the ruin guard's stun resistance. 
This will eventually allow the ruin guard to be stun locked without weak point hits.
Stun will continue until EC and HH application expires.

First clip 0:00-0:40
Evidence that this is practicable in the overworld*

1. Xingqiu's Q + Beidou's Q = electro-charged normal attacks
2. Xiao's Q empowers normal attacks and plunges to be HH capable
3. Using electro-charged N1CJP for a duration will put the ruin guard into a pseudo stun state
4. EC application expires
5. Xiao's Q expires and loses HH potential
6. Ruin guard is no longer stun locked and resumes attacking

* The weak point hit at 0:20 was accidental and does not contribute to EC/HH stunning.

Second clip 0:41-2:04
Evidence that this is practicable in the abyss

Time Stamps (Examples of heavy hit instances)
01:10 - Xiao's N1CP stuns
01:20 - Xingqiu's Q stun
01:28 - Beidou's perfect E stun 
01:30 - Beidou's Q stun
01:37 - Xiao's N1CP stun resumes


**Significance:**
- Ruin guards can be disabled without weak point hits
- Ruin guards can be more easily CC'd in close-quarters
- AOE DMG can be more easily consolidated
- Incoming DMG can be mitigated
- Abyss teams can forgo the need to an archer to disable ruin guards
