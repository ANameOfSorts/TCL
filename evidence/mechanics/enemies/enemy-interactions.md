**Finding:** 
Ruin Guards can jump over Geo Traveller's Wake of Earth walls, but cannot jump over Geo MC's Starfell Sword meteorites. However, while Wake of Earth's walls cannot block the Ruin Guard, they can sometimes interfere with its jump, making it land farther away from the player than it normally should.

**Significance:** Better knowledge of Ruin Guard combat through enemy movement manipulation with Geo MC
