**Finding:**  
Polearm users' CA that have a "leaping forward" animation won't register on a stunned Ruin Guard, if you attack right in front of it.

**Evidence:**  
Tested with Zhongli, Hutao, Xiao, & Xiangling. If you CA anywhere in front of the Ruin Guard's feet or groin, it won't go through. Your N1 still hits but the CA will not follow through. If you CA from the rear or behind, it will still register as normal. Other users confirmed that this is true for Rosaria, too. Only Xiao CA doesn't have that problem, because his CA doesn't have a "leaping forward" animation.

Both Ruin Hunter and Ruin Grader don't have this problem. My guess is because their feet hit boxes (or rather unhittable boxes) don't "expand" during their stunned models. Also, no other weapons have this problem with Ruin Guard. 

**Significance:**  
If you stun a Ruin Guard and your main carry is a spear user, you might want to watch your footing.
