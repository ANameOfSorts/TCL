## Breaking Childe's shield with stagger

**Theory:** Childe's shield is broken through stagger rather than damage.

**Evidence:** Childe has a separate poise when shielded and unshielded. The hit that breaks his shield has no hitlag. The number of hits it takes to break his shield is unaffected by damage.

**Significance:** Prioritize stagger over damage when hitting Childe's shield.
