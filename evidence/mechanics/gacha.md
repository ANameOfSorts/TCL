## Estimated 5 star pulls for weapons/characters

**By:** KBphan\#0001  
**Added:** 04/19/2021

**Finding:** It takes approximately 12.5 5 star pulls to R5 a specific weapon

Average 5 stars pulled for specific rate up 5 star weapon:

* r1 weapon \(no pity\) - 2.5
* r1 weapon \(with pity\) - 2.25
* r5 weapon \(not starting with pity\) - 12.5
* r5 weapon \(starting with pity\) - 12.25

Average 5 stars pulled for rate up 5 star character

* c0 character \(no pity\) - 1.5
* c6 character \(not starting with pity\) - 10.5
* c6 character \(starting with pity\) - 10

**Evidence:** [I made a program to brute force 10,000,000 trials](https://imgur.com/a/HastXBQ) of attempting to R5 a specific rate up 5-star using the pity rules for the weapon banner. On average it will take a player 12.5 5-star pulls to R5 their desired weapon if they only want one of the rate up 5 star weapons. This leads to an average rate of 40% for a specific 5-star weapon on the rate up banner.

**Significance:** This information can be useful for whales to figure out around how many pulls they will need to get a specific R5 on average.
