# Overworld

## Artifacts

- 4TF and 4CW set bonuses towards Overload and Superconduct do not apply to reactions involving objects or elementally modified terrain such as electrified and frozen water.

## Cursed Terrain 

- The 1.6 EM buffs didn't increase the reaction damage caused by environmental sources, such as electro crystals.
- Overworld entities like grass, water, flowers, and crystals have levels, and do damage depending on those levels.
  - Flower stamens deal damage based on a static, pre-determined level assigned to them.
  - Grass levels are dynamic and change under currently unknown circumstances.

### Electro Crystals

- The area in which an electro crystal can zap a player is [rectangular, with the crystal positioned off-center](../../../evidence/fluff/overworld.md#electro-crystal-range).
- Electro crystals near a beach/water seem to have a special electric field with many irregular properties.

### Water

- Water in Genshin exists only in horizontal, 2-dimensional sheets.
- True water, water that can be reacted with, is not graphically represented at all times, additionally, graphically represented water is only an approximation.
- Genshin's water is coded in a way where the visual water and actual layer are separate, thus there is an invisible field of water that does not apply wet in random places of the world, but can be infused.
- Applying electro to water does not produce electro-charged, instead it creates an instance of Electrified.  

### Electrified  

- Electrified is an electro+hydro reaction that can only be triggered with the useage of overworld water.  
- Electrified tick count scales with electro gauge strength applied.  
- Electrified is a harmful reaction against both player and enemy.  
- Electrified's damage is classified as transformative, but it works off of environment bases.  

### Burning Grass

Burning grass has standard ICD - 3 hits/2.5 seconds

## Other world maps  
- The current world state & character position is saved between different world maps.  

## Coordinates

* Coordinates from in-game could be translated into the Official Teyvat Interactive Map and vice versa for easier navigation.
* Character coordinates change whenever the game state is not frozen (unpaused single player).

## Burning damage Scaling  

- Burning damage scales with the affected target's EM and Level
