{% tab title="Guide to Afterlife" %} **Press** Hu Tao consumes a set portion of
her HP to knock the surrounding enemies back and enter the Paramita Papilio
state.

**Paramita Papilio**

-   Increases Hu Tao's ATK based on her Max HP at the time of entering this
    state. ATK bonus gained this way cannot exceed 400% of Hu Tao's Base ATK.
-   Converts attack DMG to Pyro DMG, which cannot be overridden by any other
    elemental infusion.
-   Charged Attacks apply the **Blood Blossom** effect to the enemies hit.
-   Increases Hu Tao's resistance to interruption.

**Blood Blossom**

Enemies affected by **Blood Blossom** will take Pyro DMG every 4s. This DMG is
considered Elemental Skill DMG.

Each enemy can be affected by only one **Blood Blossom** effect at a time, and
its duration may only be refreshed by Hu Tao herself.

**Paramita Papilio** ends when its duration is over, or Hu Tao has left the
battlefield or fallen.

{% tab title="Spirit Soother" %} Hu Tao commands a blazing spirit to attack,
dealing Pyro DMG in a large AoE. Upon striking the enemy, regenerates a
percentage of Hu Tao's Max HP. This effect can be triggered up to 5 times, based
on the number of enemies hit. If Hu Tao's HP is below or equal to 50% when the
enemy is hit, both the DMG and the HP Regeneration are increased.
