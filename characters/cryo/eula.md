**Charged Attack**

Eula drains Stamina over time to perform continuous slashes. At the end of the sequence, perform a more powerful slash.

| Type | Talent 6% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Spinning DMG | 100% |  |  |
| Final DMG | 180.81% |  |  |
| Stamina Cost | 40/s | ~ | ~ |

**Plunge Attack**  
Eula plunges from mid-air to strike the ground, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE damage upon impact.

| Plunge DMG | 108.41% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 216.78% |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Icetide Vortex" %}
**Press:**  
Slashes swiftly, dealing **Cryo** DMG. When it hits an opponent, Eula gains a stack of **Grimheart** that stacks up to 2 times. These stacks can only be gained once every 0.3 seconds.

**Hold:**  
Wielding her sword, Eula slashes forward, dealing AoE **Cryo** DMG to opponents in front of her, consuming all the stacks of **Grimheart** she possess. Each stack of **Grimheart** will be converted into an **Icewhirl** Brand that deals **Cryo** DMG to nearby opponents, decreasing their **Physical** RES and **Cryo** RES.  
Multiple hits will not cause this effect to stack, but will extend the effect's duration.

| Effect | Press | Hold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Talent 6% | 204.96% | 343.84%  |
| Icewhirl Brand DMG | ~ | 134.40% |
| Cooldown | 4s | 10s |
| GU |  |  |

**Grimheart:**  
Increases Eula's resistance to interruption and her DEF.

| Attribute | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| DEF Bonus | 30% per stack |
| Phys + Cryo RES Decrease | 21% |
| RES Decrease Duration | 7s per stack |
| Grimheart Duration | 18s |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Glacial Illumination" %}
Brandishes her greatsword, dealing **Cryo** DMG to nearby opponents and creates a Lightfall Sword that follows her around for a certain duration.

When Eula's own Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst deal DMG to opponents, they will charge the Lightfall Sword, which can gain an energy stack once every 0.1s.

Once its duration ends, the Lightfall Sword will explode violently, dealing **Physical** DMG to nearby opponents. This DMG scales on the number of energy stacks the Lightfall Sword has accumulated.

If Eula dies or leaves the field, the Lightfall Sword will immediately explode.

| Effect | Talent 6% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG | 343.84% |
