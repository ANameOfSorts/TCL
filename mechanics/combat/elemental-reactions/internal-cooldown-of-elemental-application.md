# Internal Cooldown of Elemental Application

When applying an element with an attack, there is an internal cooldown \(ICD\) on sequential applications with the same type of attack. The same type of attack can only apply an element on the first attack per 3 attacks.

* Additionally, the ICD for each attack type will reset 5 seconds after the first attack of the type is done.
* Attack types: **Normal Attacks**, **Charged Attacks**, **Plunge Attacks**, **Elemental Skills**, and **Elemental Bursts** have different counters for most cases.
* Normal Attacks between two characters use different counters.
