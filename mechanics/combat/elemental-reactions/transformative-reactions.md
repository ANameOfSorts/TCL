# Transformative Reactions

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Transformative reactions scale based off of Elemental Mastery and character level, preventing them from scaling very well.

## **Overload**

Triggering Overload in an AoE will only cause one instance of Overload damage.

* You can trigger Overload on electrocuted bodies of water.

## **Superconduct**

Triggering Superconduct in an AoE will only cause one instance of Superconduct damage.

## Electro-Charged

Electro-Charged is a special Transformative reaction that breaks the normal rule of â€œ1 elemental aura on an enemy at a time." When an enemy is Electro-Charged, both the Hydro and Electro aura lie underneath the Electro-Charged status. It follows that when applying a third element, like Pyro, you can trigger both Vaporize and Overload in the same damage instance. Since Electro-Charged hides the underlying Hydro and Electro auras, it continues to tick every second until there are 0.5s worth of Electro and Hydro aura remaining. For a more detailed description of Electro-Charged, refer to the Evidence Vault.

Electro-Charged can also spread to adjacent targets if they have a Hydro aura, however, the chain lightning applies the Electro-Charged damage without applying an elemental aura.
