# DougStrike

**DougStrike \(DS\)**: Leveraging **anything** that generates sufficient hitlag to do the following \(at the precise moment of impact\):

* DashJump \(Dash must be at least 1ms before Jump, though to most people this will feel like it's at the same time, but dash MUST be first\)
* Plunge attack 

When successful, the DashJump will cause you to gain additional vertical clearance which is a requirement for the plunge attack. Only Claymore users can reliably perform this tech. However any unit that generates sufficient hitlag can perform it, but the window for inputs will be tighter. 

Any source of movement speed boost will extend the window for inputs. This includes Diona shield, Ameno resonance, Jean C2, and some weapon effects. Sequence of events is: Hitlag generating action &gt; Hitlag occurring &gt; \(Dash &gt; Jump\) &gt; Normal attack

Please note that this tech is easiest to perform on Claymore users. It is possible to execute on 1H Sword and Polearm users, but difficult to do so.
