# Enemy Interactions

## Ruin Guards

* Polearm charge attacks, with the exception of Xiao, don't register on stunned Ruin Guards because of the "leaping forward" animation that occurs.
  * [Hu Tao vs Ruin Guard](https://youtu.be/5y6GCZar_2g)
* Ruin Guards can jump over Geo Traveller's Wake of Earth walls, but cannot jump over Geo MC's Starfell Sword meteorites.
  * While Wake of Earth's walls cannot block the Ruin Guard, they can sometimes interfere with its jump, making it land farther away from the player than it normally would.
