## Fastest Dash Techniques

The fastest movement technique for short distance is to chain dashes together with equal spacing between them with an adult male as they have biggest strides. This will ensure your dash has more up time then simply dash spamming.
For long distance you will do the same, dash chaining with maximum dash uptime on an adult male then switching to a teen male for the last dash of your stamina charge and chaining bunny hops from there on.

Note: This does not account for special dashes such as Mona.

## Bunny Hopping

Bunny hopping can let you scale walls without using stamina and it also allows you to move efficiently in the overworld. It is easiest used with teenage male model characters. This technique can also be used to scale up walls without climbing or using stamina.
