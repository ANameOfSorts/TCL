## Bush Droprates

**By:** [gideleon1\#2188](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#bush-droprates)  
**Added:** 4/11/2021

Bushes have a 8% chance to drop loot, they will drop:

* Lizards
* Eggs
* Masutakes
* Fireflies \(nightime only\)

This information can be used together with the[ infinite spawning bushes bug](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#infinite-bushes) to farm these materials.

## Destroy Mechanics

**By:** [xf3\#3123](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#destroy-function-mechanics)

The destroy function in your inventory is the only way to mass delete/destroy items in the game other than the Parametric Transformer. However, the function itself is limited and the resources gained from destroying items are not worth compared to using them as fodder.

Destroying Artifacts will give mora equal to the amount of artifact XP. While destroying weapons, will give a number of 1 star enhancement ores based on the rarity of the weapon \(3 for 3 stars, 2 for 2 stars, 1 for 1 star\).

#### Destroying +0 Artifacts:

| Rarity | Artifact XP | Mora from Destroying |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 Star | 1260 | 1260 |
| 2 Star | 840 | 840 |
| 1 Star | 420 | 420 |

#### Destroying Level 1 Weapons:

| Rarity | Weapon XP | Crystal XP from Destroying |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 Star | 1800 | 1200 |
| 2 Star | 1200 | 800 |
| 1 Star | 600 | 400 |

#### Can't be Destroyed:

* 5\* or 4\* artifacts and weapons 
* Refined 3\* weapons
* Character Development Materials
* Food \(except apples and sunsettia\)
* Gadgets 
* Quest Items
* Precious Items

Certain material items can be destroyed, but they don't give anything when destroyed, the same goes for apples and sunsettias too. However, not all material items can be destroyed, as of now, there is no consistent reason as to why.

### Resin to Stardust Exchange Comparison

**By:** [Mateng\#4507](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#resin-to-stardust-exchange-comparison)

Blue \(XP\) leylines are more stardust-efficient than Gold \(Mora\) leylines. 

* Exp Leyline: 65.33 Stardust/Resin
* Mora Leyline: 60 Stardust/Resin
* Magic Crystal Ore: 60 Stardust/Resin
