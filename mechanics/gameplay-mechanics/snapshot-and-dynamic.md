# Snapshot and Dynamic

Snapshot and Dynamic are properties assigned to skills and bursts that last over time. Most summons in the game snapshot, dynamic skills are the exception, and if they aren't listed in the Dynamic Skills section, they can be assumed to snapshot.

Summons that **snapshot** use the character's stats when cast, and will continue to use those stats regardless of buffs gained or lost in that timeframe. Only the stats visible on a character's detailed attributes page get snapshotted, buffs that affect invisible stats, such as 4pc [Blizzard Strayer](../../mechanics/equipment/artifacts.md#blizzard-strayer) or [Solar Pearl's](../../mechanics/equipment/weapons/catalysts.md#solar-pearl) passive, still effect the damage output of a snapshotting summon.

**Dynamic** summons continuously update based on the character's stats in real time.
