# Bugs

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is for bugs, meaning they could get fixed by Mihoyo at any time. If you find that a bug has been patched out, but is still on this page, go to [\#server•site•feedback](https://discord.gg/keqing) on the KQM discord.

## Abyss

You can use your overworld team in the second half of abyss even if the same members are in the first half of the chamber by [selecting retry at the same time as you kill the last enemy.](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#using-the-same-team-for-both-abyss-halves)

When using the retry button in abyss your [elemental skill and burst will not reset its cooldown]((../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#elemental-skills-and-bursts-do-not-reset-when-using-retry-in-abyss) so if you are too fast at starting the new encounter you will not be able to execute your opening moves properly.

## Overworld

[Bushes respawn infinitely](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#infinite-bushes) when Hu Tao infused with pyro sets them on fire.

## Miscellaneous

[Energy Particles don't stop moving even when you open a pause menu](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#infinite-bushes), you can also absorb them while paused too. This works in every menu, most notably adventure book and wish menu, allowing it to be used in abyss.

[Xiangling's Burst can stack](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#xianglings-burst-can-stack-in-contending-tides-event) in the Contending Tides event.

## Fixed Bugs

This is empty for now, but once Mihoyo gets their code unspaghettified, expect this to be one massive graveyard. Although, that's only **if** Mihoyo can fix their spaghetti code.
