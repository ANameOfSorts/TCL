## Abyss

You can use your overworld team in the second half of abyss even if the same members are in the first half of the chamber by [selecting retry at the same time as you kill the last enemy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW_TDsyFkPA)

## Overworld

[Bushes respawn infinitely](https://youtu.be/R5D-seBcdnU) when Hu Tao infused with pyro sets the bushes on fire.

## Miscellaneous

[Energy Particles don't stop moving even when you open a pause menu](https://youtu.be/7H84lGcZf8s), you can also absorb them while paused too. This works in every menu, most notably adventure book and wish menu, allowing it to be used in abyss.
